Problem 3: To read a matrix of size m*n from the keyboard and display the 
same on the screen using function.<br><br>
Problem 4: Rewrite the previous problem to make the row parameter of the 
matrix as a default argument.<br><br>
Problem 5: For a given set of non-negative integers and a value sum, the task is to check if there is a subset of the given set whose sum is equal 
to the given sum.<br>
Example: <br>
Input set[] = {5, 129, 6, 10, 45, 7, 9},<br>
Sum = 11<br>
Output: True (Explanation: There is a subset {5,6} with sum 11)<br>
Input set[] = {5, 129, 6, 10, 45, 7, 9},<br>
Sum = 450<br>
Output: False (Explanation: There is no such subset with sum 450)<br><br>
